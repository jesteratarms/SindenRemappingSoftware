Hi, thought it would be helpful to have a way to swap different profiles for different games for the Sinden Lightgun.  

Install Process
You'll need python installed.
I would put this file in the same folder as your Lightgun.exe file.  This utility only works with the Windows version currently.

It will create a folder called Config Files when it's started.  Technically config files can be loaded from anywhere though.

This project is a fan project and unaffiliated with Sinden.  Also my first project on github, so any feedback or features you'd like to see would be appreciated.
